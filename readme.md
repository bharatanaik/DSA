# DSA lab programs


1. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following Array Operations
    - Creating an Array of N Integer Elements
    -  Display of Array Elements with Suitable Headings
    -  Exit.

    Support the program with functions for each of the above operations.


2. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following Array operations 
    - Inserting an Element (ELEM) at a given valid Position (POS)
    - Deleting an Element at a given valid Position POS)
    - Display of Array Elements
    - Exit.

    Support the program with functions for each of the above operation

3. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on 
STACK of Integers (Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX)
    - Push an Element on to Stack
    - Pop an Element from Stack
    - Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack
    - Display the status of Stack
    - Exit

    Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations

4. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following Stack Applications 
    - Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, *, /, %, ^
    - Solving Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks

5. Singly Linked List (SLL) of Integer Data 
    - Create a SLL stack of N integer.
    - Display of SLL
    - Linear search. 
    
    Create a SLL queue of N Students Data Concatenation of two SLL of 
integers.
6. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operationson 
Doubly Linked List (DLL) of Professor Data with the fields: ID, Name, Branch, Area of 
specialization
    - Create a DLL stack of N Professor’s Data.
    - Create a DLL queue of N Professor’s Data
Display the status of DLL and count the number of nodes in it.


7. Given an array of elements, construct a complete binary tree from this array in level order 
fashion. That is, elements from left in the array will be filled in the tree level wise starting from 
level 0. 
- Ex: Input : 
    
    arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    
    Output : Root of the following tree
 
            1
           / \
          2   3
         / \ / \
        4   5   6
8. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on 
Binary Search Tree (BST) of Integers
    - Create a BST of N Integers
    - Traverse the BST in Inorder, Preorder and Post Order

9. Design, Develop and implement a program in C for the following operations on Graph (G) of cities
    - Create a Graph of N cities using Adjacency Matrix.
    - Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a diagraph using DFS/BFS 
method.

10. Design and develop a program in C that uses Hash Function H:K->L as H(K)=K mod m(reminder 
method) and implement hashing technique to map a given key K to the address space L. Resolve 
the collision (if any) using linear probing.
